this project is simple project used to put random estimates of a coocki shop located in 5 cities , this part was very basic it only took a min value and a max value and average of coocki sales and i used a random number fuction to generate a random number of costumer per day. this project is the first part of five parts. 

As for lab 7 we turned the un ordered lists to tables using JavaScript (the hardway) but it was good, we refined the code turning the literal code in constructor functions and created the table using JavaScript to veiw the data in a grid format

the index.html file is modified and with the sites locations shown as unordered list and extra information is added to the index as plain text nothing is speciel... i forgot myself and did some CSS which is commented out from the HTML.
